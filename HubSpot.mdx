</Steps>

## Authentication Methods

### OAuth

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Sign in** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the HubSpot sign-in page in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your HubSpot account and provide the requested permissions (if applicable).
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add HubSpot Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
### PrivateAppToken

Enter the Hubspot Private App Token in the **OAuth Access Token** field.

You can generate a HubSpot Private App Token by following the steps below.

In your HubSpot account, click the **Settings** icon in the main navigation bar.
</Step>
<Step>
In the left sidebar menu, navigate to **Integrations > Private Apps**.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Create private app**.
</Step>

On the **Basic Info** tab, configure the details of your application (name, logo, and description).
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Scopes** tab, select **Read** or **Write** for each scope you want your private application to be able to access. This determines the data the driver has access to retrieve.
</Step>
<Step>
After you are done configuring your application, click **Create app** in the top right. Review the information about your application's access token, click **Continue creating**, and then **Show token**.
</Step>
