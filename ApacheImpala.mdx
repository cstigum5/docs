## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect Apache Impala to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *Apache Impala* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Select a **Transport Mode** of **BINARY** or **HTTP**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **HTTP Path**—(HTTP transport mode only) the path component of the URL endpoint. The default value is "cliservice".
	- **User**—the Apache Impala username for authentication.
	- **Password**—the user password.
	- **Port**—the port for connecting to the Apache Impala server. For HTTP transport mode, this should be set to the value of the 'hs2\_http\_port' property of the Impala configuration (default: 28000).
	- **Server**—the name or network address of the SQL Server instance.
	- **Database**—(optional) the name of the Impala database to connect to. If not specified, the default database schema is used.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Apache Impala Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
