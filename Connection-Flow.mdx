Creating a connection to a Connect AI data source from a client account involves the following steps:
<Steps>
<Step>
An end user of your customer’s account clicks **Add Connection** on your web page.
</Step>
<Step>
Your application creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by a private key and makes a request to the Embedded Cloud Create Connection API.
</Step>
<Step>
Embedded Cloud returns a redirect URL to your application.
</Step>
<Step>
The end user is redirected to the Connect AI **Add Connection** page.
</Step>
<Step>
The end user adds connection information for the particular data connector, such as Salesforce, and then tests and saves the connection.
</Step>
<Step>
Embedded Cloud calls [Create Connection](https://cloud.cdata.com/docs/Connection-Management.html).
</Step>
<Step>
Create Connection returns success or failure on the **Add Connection** page.
</Step>
<Step>
The end user clicks the **Close** button. Embedded Cloud redirects with a connection Id back to your web page.

Your web page now displays the end user’s list of connections.
