## Generic Authentication Methods

### GenericOAuth

The **Callback URL**, or Redirect URL, is the URL you need (`https://oauth.cdata.com/oauth/`) when setting up your OAuth app. Copy this URL and paste it into your OAuth app.

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **OAuth Client Id**—the Id assigned when you registered your FHIR account.
	- **OAuth Client Secret**—the client secret for your FHIR account.
	- **OAuth Authorization URL**—the URL where the user logs into OAuth and grants permissions to the application.
	- **OAuth Access Token URL**—the URL where authorization tokens can be exchanged for access tokens.
	- **URL**—the URL of the FHIR server. A sample generic URL is as follows: `http://my_fhir_server/r4b/`.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign in** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the FHIR sign-in page in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your FHIR account and provide the requested permissions (if applicable).
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add FHIR Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**.
