## Issue Queries

In some configurations of Excel for the web, tables are accessible under the schema name OneDrive instead of ExcelOnline. For example, when querying a Excel for the web table, the fully-qualified table name might be `[ExcelOnline1].[OneDrive].[TableName]`. You can use [Data Explorer](https://cloud.cdata.com/Data-Explorer.html) to view your schemas to see if this applies to your configuration.
