## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect Bing Ads to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *Bing Ads* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your **Customer Id**. You can find this Id by logging into your Bing Ads account and navigating to the **Accounts and Billing** settings page. Your customer Id also appears as the final number in the Bing Ads URL when you are logged in (for example, `azure.bingads.microsoft.com/cc/AccountDetails?cid=123456789`).
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your **Developer Token**. To get the token, log in to the [Bing Ads Developer Portal](https://developers.ads.microsoft.com/Account) as a Microsoft Account user with the **Bing Ads Super Admin** role. Then, click **Request Token**.
</Step>
<Step>
(Optional) Enter your **Account Id**. This can be found in your Bing Ads account by navigating to the **Accounts and Billing** settings page. Then, click **Your Account**. If not specified, the connection automatically queries the first account found.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign in** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the Bing Ads sign-in page in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your Bing Ads account and provide the requested permissions (if applicable).
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Bing Ads Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
