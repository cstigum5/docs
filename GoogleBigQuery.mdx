## Authentication Methods

### Oauth

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Sign in with Google** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the Google BigQuery sign-in page on a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your Google BigQuery account.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Continue** to grant the requested permissions.

<Note>
Each permission is required for the connection to function.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step>
The **Project Id** field populates with your Google BigQuery project Ids. Select a project Id from the drop-down list or enter a custom value.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Google BigQuery Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
### Oauth JWT

<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Project Id** field, enter the Google BigQuery project that you want to use.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the **OAuth JWT Cert** provided by Google. This is a multi-line key.
</Step>
<Step>
(Optional) Enter the **OAuth JWT Subject** if your services account is part of a GSuite domain and you want to enable delegation.
</Step>
