With Connect AI, you can unify access to all of the cloud applications, databases, APIs, and services across an organization.

## Key Features

- **Broad Data Connectivity:** Connect AI allows you to transform data into a simple language that any reporting tool, analytics dashboard, or spreadsheet can understand. It can connect to a vast range of applications (including those for accounting, marketing, customer relationship management, and more) by using a consistent approach that is already supported by many data tools.
- **Real-Time Data Access:** Connect AI gives you access to your data in real time, which creates an agile and flexible work environment that adapts and changes as quickly as your data does. This approach avoids the pitfalls of traditional Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes that rely on moving data to separate locations.
- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Support:** Read and Write operations are supported. Operations are controlled by security settings that you can configure in Connect AI or in your data sources.
- **Secure Access:** Administrators can create query users and define their access permissions for each data source individually.
- **Comprehensive Data Model & Dynamic Discovery:** Connect AI provides comprehensive access to all of the data that is exposed in the underlying connections, including full access to dynamic data and searchable metadata.
- **Workspaces:** Connect AI provides a sleek way to organize, catalog, and control access to specific data. You can bundle related data items separately in a simple and scalable way with workspaces.
