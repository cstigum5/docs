## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

Once your connection is created, it appears under the **From Existing Data Sources** section of your Dataset list.

When selecting Schema, make sure to avoid any dbo schemas and select the actual schema instead.
