description: "Connect AI workspaces allow you to connect OData-compatible integration tools to your data without installing any extra software or drivers. You must configure workspaces to access data from integration tools with the OData protocol."

## Configure Tables

To configure tables, refer to the [Workspaces](/Workspaces) documentation.

## Authentication

Applications connect to the OData API through Basic Authentication (username and password). When configuring a connection, set the connection properties as follows:

- Set the URL as the OData Service URL with a workspace name (`https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace_name}`).
- For the Username, enter your Connect AI username. This is displayed in the top-right corner of the Connect AI interface. For example, *test@cdata.com*.
- For the Password, enter a Personal Access Token (PAT) that you generate on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page.

## Connect from Client Applications

The pages below provide instructions on connecting to the OData API from within popular client applications:

- [PowerBI](/PowerBI.com-Client)
- [Salesforce Lightning Connect](https://cloud.cdata.com/SF-Lightning-Connect.html)
- [SAP Analytics Cloud](/SAPAnalyticsCloud-Client)

The sections below outline how to connect from cURL and Postman.

### cURL

The [cURL command line tool](https://curl.se/) provides one of the simplest ways to retrieve OData tables. In your request, pass your username and PAT as Basic Auth credentials in the following format:

```bash
curl -u 'test@cdata.com:QpnquoIujrBNunK' https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace_name}/
```

With this request, cURL returns the OData response directly to the standard output.

### Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a testing utility tool that can easily connect to the Connect AI OData API. To use Postman, set the following settings:

<Steps>
<Step>
Set the HTTP operation to **GET**
</Step>
<Step>
Set the request URL to *https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace\_name}*. If desired, you can specify a resource name.
</Step>
<Step>
In the Authorization tab, set the Auth type to **Basic Auth**
</Step>
<Step>
Set the Username and password to the username and authentication token from the [Users](/Users) tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Send** to submit your request to Connect
</Step>
</Steps>

Postman will display the OData results in the response section.
