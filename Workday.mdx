## Authentication Methods

### OAuth

To connect Workday to Connect AI using OAuth, you must first create an OAuth app in Workday. [Create an OAuth app in Workday](#create-an-oauth-app-in-workday) shows how to create a standard OAuth app. For other types of OAuth custom apps, refer to [this information page](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/JWK/cloud/default.htm#pg_connectiondatahubh).

The **Callback URL**, or Redirect URL, is the URL you need (`https://oauth.cdata.com/oauth/`) when setting up your OAuth app. Copy this URL and paste it into your OAuth app.

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **OAuth Client Id**—the client Id assigned when you register your application with an OAuth authorization server.
	- **OAuth Client Secret**—the client secret assigned when you register your application with an OAuth authorization server.
	- **Base URL**—the base URL for the Workday connection. To obtain the Base URL, log in to Workday and search for View API Clients. In the listed values, find the Workday REST API Endpoint. For example, in the URL `https://wd3-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/mycompany_gms1/Human_Resources`, `https://wd3-impl-services1.workday.com` is the Base URL.
	- **Tenant**—the tenant for the account. The tenant is found in your Tenant Setup page in Workday. It is used when constructing a URL to retrieve data from Workday. For example, in the URL `https://wd3-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/mycompany_gms1/Human_Resources`, `mycompany_gms1` is the tenant.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign in** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the Workday sign-in page in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your Workday account and provide the requested permissions (if applicable).
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Workday Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
