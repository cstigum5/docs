In the **User Profile** section, you can edit the first name and last name for the current user. Your user role appears in the **Role** text box, but it cannot be edited on this page. See [Users](/Users) for more information about roles.

If you want to reset your password, click **Reset Password**. This action sends a password reset email to the email address that appears in **Email**.

In the **Grant Support Access** section, administrators can toggle support access on so that the CData support team can log on and help troubleshoot issues for the users in the administrator's account. Support access expires automatically on the date specified. However, administrators can revoke access at any time by disabling this setting. Click **Save Changes** to save the selection. Click **Accept** in the **Grant Support Access** dialog to agree to the terms and conditions of granting support access. <Note>This feature is enabled for administrators only. Query users can contact their administrator to grant support access to their accounts.</Note>

## Account
