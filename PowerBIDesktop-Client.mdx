## Step 2: Import Data

After you connect to Connect AI, follow these steps to import data to Power BI Desktop:

<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Navigator** dialog, expand the **Connections**, **Derived Views**, or **Workspaces** folder to locate the data to load.
The data is organized in the Navigator as follows:
- **Connections** > **Schemas** > **Table/View/Stored Procedure**
- **Derived Views** > **Derived View**
- **Workspaces** > **Assets** > **Table/View/Stored Procedure**
For example, to load a specific table within a connection, expand **Connections**, and then expand the connection name. Expand the appropriate schema and then select the table(s) to load, as shown below.

</Step>
<Step>
Check the boxes next to the any data that you want to work with. You can view a preview of the data if you wish.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Load** or **Transform Data**.
- **Load** instructs the connector to execute the underlying query to Connect AI.
- **Transform Data** launches the Query Editor and displays a representative view of the table. To run a custom query through this interface, see [Running a Custom Query](#running-a-custom-query).
</Step>
<Step>
Create Power BI visuals with the data you loaded.
</Step>
</Steps>



### Running a Custom Query

To run a custom query on your data, select **Transform Data** when you are importing from Connect AI and folllow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>

</Step>
</Steps>



```bash
let
     Source = CDataConnectCloud.Contents([Query="SELECT ACCOUNTNUMBER, BILLINGSTREET, BILLINGCITY, BILLINGSTATE FROM [Snowflake3].[NORTHWIND].[ACCOUNT] LIMIT 100"])
  in
     Source
```
