## Step 1: Create a Report in Power BI Desktop

PowerBI.com does not support data import directly from Connect AI. Instead, you must first create a report of your data using Power BI Desktop, and then you can publish this report to PowerBI.com.

Please see [Power BI Desktop](/PowerBIDesktop-Client) and follow the steps to connect to Connect AI and import your data. When you finish this process, save your report and continue with the steps below.

## Step 2: Publish to PowerBI.com

<Steps>
<Step>
With your report open in Power BI Desktop, click **Publish** in the **Home** tab of the navigation ribbon.
