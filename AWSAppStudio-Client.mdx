This page outlines the steps to connect AWS App Studio to your Connect AI account.

## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- [Add a workspace](/Workspaces#add-a-workspace) to Workspaces.
- [Add assets](/Workspaces#workspace-assets) to your workspace.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

<Steps>
<Step>
In **Workspaces** in Connect AI, select a workspace and download the OpenAPI specification for the workspace. See [OpenAPI](/OpenAPI) for more information.
