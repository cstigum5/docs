## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

## Connect to Connect AI with Axios

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a project directory, for example, `connect_cloud`.
</Step>
<Step>
Open the terminal in the project directory and initialize a node project as follows:

```bash
npm init -y
```
</Step>
<Step>
Install the Axios dependency in the project with the following command:

```bash
npm install axios
```
</Step>
<Step>
In your project directory, create a file called `server.js` that contains the following code. Provide your Connect AI `username` and `pat` (the PAT you created in the prerequisites). You must also provide a `query` for your data, such as `SELECT * FROM Snowflake1.PUBLIC.Accounts`.

```javascript expandable
const axios = require('axios')
 const user = 'username'
 const pat = '***********************************';
 //Your API endpoint
 const url = 'https://cloud.cdata.com/api/query';
 //Your data to be sent in the POST request
 const data = {
 "query":"SELECT * FROM Snowflake1.PUBLIC.Accounts"
 };
 axios.post(url, data, {
     auth: {
         username: user,
         password: pat
     }
 })
 .then(response => {
     const rows = response.data.results[0].rows;
     const schema = response.data.results[0].schema;
     //Create an array of column names
     const columnNames = schema.map(col => col.columnName);
     //Loop through each row and log the column name with its value
     rows.forEach(row => {
         const rowObject = {};
         row.forEach((value, index) => {
             const columnName = columnNames[index];
             rowObject[columnName] = value;
         });
         console.log(rowObject);
     })
 })
 .catch(error => {
     console.error('Error:', error);
 });
```
</Step>
<Step>
In the terminal, execute the following command to run the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The query results appear.
