## Update Data

You can push changes from the Google Sheets spreadsheet to the originating data connection. Note that in order to update a spreadsheet, the data must contain at least one primary key. You must also have the proper permissions to update the source data. You cannot update read-only fields in the originating data connection.

Be sure to update your data frequently if you are using the auto refresh feature, or your changes may be overwritten by the originating data connection.

<Note>
CData Connect Spreadsheets does not support updates for views (only tables).
</Note>

To update data in your spreadsheet, follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
Make your changes to the Google Sheets spreadsheet. When you update data, the data is highlighted in red to signify that it is not yet updated to the originating data connection.
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to update only select rows, highlight the cells or rows to be updated.
</Step>
<Step>

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Execute**. Click **Confirm** to continue. This action updates the originating data connection and cannot be undone.
</Step>
<Step>
CData Connect Spreadsheets returns a message whether the update was successful. If unsuccessful, CData Connect Spreadsheets displays the reason the update failed.
</Step>
<Step>
If the update is successful, the data in red turns black. This indicates that the data is updated in the originating data connection.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
<Step>
If necessary, return to the main menu of the CData Connect Spreadsheets add-on.

</Step>
<Step>

</Step>
<Step>
Determine whether you want to **Update Selected** rows or **Update All**.

## Logs

Click **Logs** to open a dialog that lists the three most recent queries, including:

- The time and date they occurred
- Their results (success or failure)
- The contents and parameters of the queries

See [Logs](/Logs) for more information.

## Advanced Query Settings

When importing data, you can use [Filters](#filters) and [Sorting](#sorting) to build your query.

### Filters

To add a filter, click the **+** next to the **Filters** header. You can add more filters by clicking the **+** again, and you can delete a filter by clicking the trash can icon next to it.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/sheets_filter.png" alt="Sheets Filter" />
</Frame>

Each filter has three fields to fill out:

- **Column**—select the column from your table that you want to filter.
- **Op**—the operation the filter performs. Options are *equals*, *does not equal*, *contains*, *does not contain*, *less than*, *less than or equal to*, *greater than*, and *greater than or equal to*.
- **Value**—the value for the filter operation.

For example, if you wanted to retrieve AccountValues above $100,000, you might set the Column to *AccountValues*, the Op to *greater than*, and the Value to *100,000*. Then, when you execute the query, only results matching this filter will be returned.

As you enter your filter parameters, the **Generated Query** at the bottom of the pane automatically updates.

### Sorting

To add a sorting rule to your query results, click the **+** next to the **Sort By** header. You can add more sorting rules by clicking the **+** again, and you can delete a sorting rule by clicking the trash can icon next to it.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/sheets_sort.png" alt="Sheets Sort" />
</Frame>

Each sorting rule requires a **Column** and a sorting **Order** (ascending or descending). If you add multiple sorting rules, the results are sorted in the order that the rules appear. The query gives highest sorting priority to the first rule, then the second rule, etc.

As you enter your sorting parameters, the **Generated Query** at the bottom of the pane automatically updates.
