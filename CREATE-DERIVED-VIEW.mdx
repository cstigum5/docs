## CREATE DERIVED VIEW Syntax

The CREATE DERIVED VIEW statement specifies the view name and the contents of the SQL query, as shown in the following example:

```sql
CREATE DERIVED VIEW [<view_name>] AS <sql_query_contents>
```

The following example statement creates a derived view called MyViewName, with the query `SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 20;`

```sql
CREATE DERIVED VIEW [MyViewName] AS SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 20;
```
