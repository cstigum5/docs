EXEC and EXECUTE assign stored procedure inputs, referenced by name, to values or parameter names.

## Stored Procedure Syntax

To execute a stored procedure as an SQL statement, use the following syntax:

```bash
{ EXECUTE | EXEC } <stored_proc_name>
{
  [ @ ] <input_name> = <expression>
} [ , ... ]
 
<expression> ::=
  | @ <parameter>
  | ?
  | <literal>
```

## Example Statements

Below is an example of how to reference stored procedure inputs by name:

```bash
EXECUTE my_proc @second = 2, @first = 1, @third = 3;
```

Below is an example of how to execute a parameterized stored procedure statement:

```bash
EXECUTE my_proc second = @p1, first = @p2, third = @p3;
```
