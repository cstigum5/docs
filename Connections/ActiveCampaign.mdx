## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect ActiveCampaign to your Connect AI account:
<Steps>
<Step>
 Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
 Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
 Type *ActiveCampaign* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
 On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
 Enter the following information:
	- **API Key**—the API Key for your ActiveCampaign account. Find this in your account on the **Settings** page under the **Developer** tab. Each user in your ActiveCampaign account has their own unique API key.
	- **URL**—find this in your account on the **My Settings** page under the **Developer** tab. For example: `https://{yourAccountName}.api-us1.com`
</Step>
<Step>
 At the top of the Connect AI **Add ActiveCampaign Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.
	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
