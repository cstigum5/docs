 At the top of the Connect AI **Add Act! CRM Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.
	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**.

If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
