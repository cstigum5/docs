## Authentication Methods

### APIToken

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **Api Key**—the API key that allows you to make requests to the Backlog API. You can generate this key by opening the Settings page in Backlog and selecting the **API** section.
	- **URL**—the URL of the Backlog account.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Backlog Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
