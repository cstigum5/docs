description: "This page outlines the steps to connect Jitterbit to Connect AI using the [OData](/OData-Dashboard) protocol. This requires the use of workspaces. See the [Workspaces](/Workspaces) documentation for more information."

## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Create a [Workspace](/Workspaces). Later, you will use the **OData Service URL** on that page (*https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace\_name}*) with the relevant workspace name to establish the connection.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.
