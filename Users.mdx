## About Users

A ***user*** is an account that can log in and use your account. Two types of Connect AI users are available:

- **Administrators** have full access to all Connect AI functions, including adding and managing users.
- **Query users** can issue queries to established connections through the [Data Explorer](/Data-Explorer) page and through [integration tools](/Integrations). They cannot access administrative functions, including [Sources](/Sources) and user management.

Every account must have at least one active administrator.

<Note>
  By default, all CData Connect Spreadsheets users have Administrator privileges. They have full Select, Insert, Update, Delete, and Execute permissions.
</Note>

## Users List

The **Users** list displays the following information:

- A button to [invite users](#invite-users).
- The number of **user seats** that are available on your account and a **[Manage Subscription](/Settings#billing)** link.
- A row for every user on your account:
	- **User** displays the email address that is associated with the user.
	- **Role** indicates the user’s role (Administrator or Query).
	- **Status** shows the state of the user’s account (**Active**, **Inactive**, or **Invited**).
	- Buttons to edit and delete the user. If the user's status is **Invited**, there is also a button to resend their invitation.

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Accept Invite** in the invitation email to open the password creation page.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a password that meets the provided criteria. After you create a password, the login page appears.
</Step>
<Step>

	</Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Connect AI supports Single Sign-On (SSO) through popular SSO providers. If SSO is enabled on your account, the invitation flow uses your SSO provider instead of the manual password process.
</Note>

### Managing Invitations

If a user has a pending invitation that they have not accepted, their status displays as **Invited**. Click a pending user to view and manage their invitation.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/user_pending.png" alt="Pending user" />
</Frame>

On this page, you can view the pending user’s email address, the expiration time for the invitation, and the invite code. You can also manage the user’s invitation, as follows:

- To revoke the invitation and delete the user, click **Delete User**.
- To resend the invitation email to the entered email address, click **Resend Invite**.

## Edit User

Click a user in the list to open the **Edit User** page.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/edit_user.png" alt="Edit user" />
</Frame>

This page contains the following information:

- Editable **First Name** and **Last Name** fields.
- A non-editable **Email** field.
- A drop-down menu to select the user’s **Role** (**Administrator** or **Query User**)
- A toggle for enabling or disabling **Support Access Privileges** (query users only). If selected, the query user can grant account access to the CData support team.
- Check boxes for toggling the user’s permissions for each data source. (Note that CData Connect Spreadsheets users do not have a permissions section, because they have full permissions.)

To save changes to the user, click **Save Changes**. To delete the user, click **Delete User**.

<Note>
  If the user is the last remaining Administrator on your account, they cannot be deleted.
