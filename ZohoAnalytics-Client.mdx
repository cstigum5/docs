## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

## Connect to Connect AI

To establish a connection from Zoho Analytics to the Connect AI Virtual SQL Server API, follow these steps.

<Steps>
<Step>
Log in to Zoho Analytics.
</Step>
<Step>
Create a new connection and select **Other Cloud Services** to open the connection dialog.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
- **Database Type**—select *MS SQL Server*.
- **Endpoint**—enter *tds.cdata.com*
- **SQL Server Instance Name**—leave this blank.
- **Port**—enter *14333*
- **Username**—enter your Connect AI username. This is displayed in the top-right corner of the Connect AI interface. For example, *test@cdata.com*.
- **Password**—enter the PAT you generated on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page.
- **Database Name**—enter the Connection Name of the Connect AI data source you want to connect to (for example, *Salesforce1*).
- **Connection Type**—select *Data Import*.

</Step>
<Step>
Click **Next** to test and create your connection.
</Step>
<Step>
Continue through each step of the connection dialog to import your data as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>



When the data import process finishes, your data will be available to use in Zoho Analytics.

<Note>
If your table contains underscores, such as `account_move`, you need to first create a derived view for that table without an underscore in the name. Then load the derived view instead. Zoho Analytics cannot load tables whose names include underscores.
