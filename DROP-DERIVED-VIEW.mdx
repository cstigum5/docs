## DROP DERIVED VIEW Syntax

The DROP DERIVED VIEW statement accepts the name of the derived view to delete, as shown in the following example:

```sql
DROP DERIVED VIEW [<view_name>]
```

The following query deletes the derived view MyView. It can no longer be used.

```sql
DROP DERIVED VIEW [MyViewName]
```
