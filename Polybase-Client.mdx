<Steps>
<Step>
Create a database scoped `CREDENTIAL` for connecting to the SQL Server. It should map `IDENTITY` and `SECRET` to your database's Username and Password respectively. Follow the example below.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SqlServerCredentials
 WITH IDENTITY = 'yourusername', SECRET = 'yourpassword';
```
</Step>
<Step>
Using `CREATE EXTERNAL DATASOURCE`, create an external datasource that names the instance, identifies the external data source, and sets whether computation should be pushed via `PUSHDOWN` to source by default. This uses the `CREDENTIAL` created above. Use the below example as a template.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE SQLServerInstance
 WITH ( LOCATION = 'sqlserver://tds.cdata.com:14333',
 PUSHDOWN = ON,
 CREDENTIAL = SQLServerCredentials);
```
</Step>
<Step>
Create the external table using `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE`. The statement needs collation and the location must be in three-part notation `<database>.<schema>.<table>`. See below for a functional example.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE DatabasesExternal (
     name VARCHAR(128) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS)
   WITH (LOCATION = 'QuickBooksOnline1.QuickBooksOnline.Accounts',
   DATA_SOURCE = SQLServerInstance);
```
</Step>
<Step>
For optimal query performance, you can create statistics on external table columns, as per the code example below.

```sql
CREATE STATISTICS statistics_name ON customer (C_CUSTKEY)
 WITH FULLSCAN;
```
</Step>
