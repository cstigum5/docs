## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect Jira Assets to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.

<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *Jira Assets* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the **URL** to your Jira Assets endpoint, for example, `https://yoursitename.atlassian.net`.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Jira Assets username for authentication in the **User** field.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Jira **API token** for the username that you entered in the **User** field. To create an API token:
	- Navigate to [the API Tokens page of your Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens).
	- Click **Create API token**.
	- Name your API token and adjust the expiration date, if necessary.
	- Click **Create**.
	- Copy and paste the API token.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Jira Assets Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
