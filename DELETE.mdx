## DELETE Syntax

The DELETE statement requires the table name in the FROM clause and the row's primary key in the WHERE clause, as shown in the following example:

```bash
<delete_statement> ::= DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE { Id = <expression> } [ { AND | OR } ... ]
 
<expression> ::=
  | @ <parameter>
  | ?
  | <literal>
```

The following is an example query:

```bash
DELETE FROM Orders WHERE Id = @myId
```
