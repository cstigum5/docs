<Note>
Before you can configure and use Python with Connect AI, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
</Note>

## Install the Driver

Follow these steps to download and install the driver:

<Steps>
<Step>
Download and extract the setup archive for your operating system.
	- [Mac Download](https://www.cdata.com/download/getfile.aspx?file=free/LFVK-X/setup_mac.zip&name=CData%20Connect%20Python%20Connector&tag=Download-connect)
	- [Windows Download](https://www.cdata.com/download/getfile.aspx?file=free/LFVK-X/setup_win.zip&name=CData%20Connect%20Python%20Connector&tag=Download-connect)
	- [Linux Download](https://www.cdata.com/download/getfile.aspx?file=free/LFVK-X/setup_unix.zip&name=CData%20Connect%20Python%20Connector&tag=Download-connect)
</Step>
<Step>
Follow the steps below for your operating system.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Windows Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
In the extracted archive, open the `win` folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Choose the folder for your Python version, and then the folder for your bitness. For example, if you have Python 3.9 and a 64-bit operating system, open the `win > Python39 > 64` folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Open a command prompt and run `pip install` for the `.whl` setup file. For example, a 64-bit Python 3.9 install would be `pip install cdata_connect_connector-21.0.8049-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Mac and Unix Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
In the extracted archive, open the `mac` or `unix` folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Open a Python terminal and run `pip install` for the appropriate `.tar.gz` setup file. For example, a Python 3.9 install would be `pip install cdata-connect-connector-21.0.8049-python39.tar.gz`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connect to Connect AI

Follow these steps for an example of how to connect to Connect AI from your Python code:

<Steps>
<Step>
Import `cdata.connect`, create a connection object, and and pass the connection string as an argument, as in the example below:

```python
import cdata.connect as mod
 conn = mod.connect("AuthScheme=OAuth;")
```
</Step>
<Step>
If you are not already logged into Connect AI, the OAuth login page opens in your default web browser. Log in to continue.
</Step>
<Step>
You can execute SQL statements using this connection. For example, the commands below print all entries for **Id** in a MailChimp connection:

```python
cur = conn.execute("SELECT Id FROM MailChimp1.MailChimp.AuthorizedApps")
 rs = cur.fetchall()
 for row in rs:
     print(row)
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Connect to a Workspace

You can connect the Python client to a specific [workspace](/Workspaces) as follows:

```python
import cdata.connect as mod
   conn = mod.connect("AuthScheme=OAuth;Workspace=MyWorkspace")
```
