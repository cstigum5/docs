View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.

Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
