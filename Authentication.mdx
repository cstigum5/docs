To authenticate a request using Basic Authentication, pass the Base64-encoded login credentials of a registered user in the `Authorization` header of the request. Follow this guidance when passing the credentials:

- The username is the email address of the user, e.g. `user@cdata.com`.
- The password is a Personal Access Token (PAT) that you generate from the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page.
- If your application or service does not automatically Base64-encode the string, follow these steps to encode it manually:
    - Separate the username and PAT with a colon, for example, `user@cdata.com:token`.
    - Use Base64 to encode the colon-separated string.


The following is an example of a curl command that calls the API to return results from a Salesforce Account table:

```bash
curl -X POST https://cloud.cdata.com/api/query
   -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   -d '{"query":"SELECT * FROM Salesforce1.Salesforce.Account LIMIT 10"}'
   --user "user@cdata.com:123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

Since curl automatically Base64-encodes basic authentication credentials, it is not necessary to manually perform this encoding before sending the request.
