## Step 1: Sign In

<Steps>
<Step>
Go to [https://cloud.cdata.com/](https://cloud.cdata.com/).
</Step>
<Step>
Sign in with your CData account.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect Your First Source

### Example: Salesforce (OAuth)

<Steps>
<Step>
Open **Sources** > **Add Connection** > **Salesforce**.
</Step>
<Step>
Select **OAuth** authentication (recommended).
</Step>
<Step>
Provide:
	- **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Salesforce (*Setup > App Manager > Your Connected App*).
	- **Callback URL** shown in Connect AI.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Authorize** and sign in with Salesforce.
</Step>
<Step>
**Test** connection, and then **Save**.
</Step>
</Steps>

***Done!*** *You can now query `Account`, `Opportunity`, `Contact`, and other objects in real time.*

### Example: Google BigQuery (OAuth)

<Steps>
<Step>
Open **Sources** > **Add Connection** > **Google BigQuery**.
</Step>
<Step>
Sign in with your Google account.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the project and dataset(s) to expose.
</Step>
<Step>
Test connection, and Save.
</Step>
</Steps>
	*Your BigQuery datasets are now queryable via SQL, OData, and REST.*

*Other authentication options include Username/Password (legacy) and OAuth with Refresh Token for long-lived access.*

## Step 3: Explore and Query Your Data

<Steps>
<Step>
Open **Explorer** and select your source.
</Step>
<Step>
Run a query:
	```sql
	SELECT Name, StageName, Amount
	FROM Opportunity
	WHERE CloseDate >= CURRENT_DATE - 90
	ORDER BY Amount DESC;
	```
</Step>
</Steps>

*Save as a **\*Derived View*** to reuse and share.\*

## Step 4: Create Derived Views

Derived Views are saved SQL definitions you can permission like tables.

```sql
CREATE DERIVED VIEW Sales.TopOpportunities AS
SELECT Name, StageName, Amount
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = false AND CloseDate >= CURRENT_DATE - 90
ORDER BY Amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

*Use **\*Scheduled Queries*** under ***Jobs*** to refresh cached results for heavy workloads.\*

## Step 5: Use Data in Your Tools

### Power BI (SQL endpoint)

<Steps>
<Step>
Open Power BI Desktop and then select **Get Data** > **SQL Server**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your Connect Cloud SQL endpoint (*tds.cdata.com*).
</Step>
<Step>
Authenticate with your CData credentials.
</Step>
<Step>
Select tables or derived views and build visuals.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Excel (OData)

<Steps>
<Step>
In Excel, select **Data** > **Get Data** > **From Other Sources** > **From OData Feed**.
</Step>
<Step>
Paste your Connect Cloud OData endpoint (*https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace\_name}*).
</Step>
<Step>
Authenticate with your CData credentials and load data.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Tableau (OData or SQL)

<Steps>
<Step>
In Tableau, select **Connect** > **OData Server** (or **SQL Server**).
</Step>
<Step>
Enter either the OData or SQL Server endpoint, authenticate, and start exploring.
</Step>
</Steps>

### AI and Apps (Rest/OpenAPI)

Expose any source as a secure API for custom apps and large language models (LLMs).

- REST provides programmatic access from apps/agents:
	```bash
	GET https://cloud.cdata.com/api.rsc/Salesforce/Opportunity Authorization: Bearer <token>
	```
- OData v4 is used for BI tools and pagination/filtering:
	```bash
	GET https://cloud.cdata.com/odata/Salesforce/Opportunity?$top=100&$orderby=Amount desc
	```
- OpenAPI generates clients and validates requests:
	```bash
	GET https://cloud.cdata.com/openapi/Salesforce
	```

## Step 6: Organize with Workspaces

<Steps>
<Step>
In Workspaces, **Add Workspace** and name the workspace (for example, Sales).
</Step>
<Step>
Add sources and derived views needed by the team.
</Step>
<Step>
Share with groups to grant access.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Permissions by Need-to-Know

Control access at source, schema, table, or view level

| **Permission** | **What it allows** |
|:- |:- |
| SELECT | Read/query data |
| INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE | Write changes back (if source allows) |
| EXECUTE | Run procedures (such as refresh metadata) |

## Security and Best Practices

- **Rate limits**: 100 requests/user/minute.
- **IP allowlist**: Restrict access to trusted networks.
- **Logging & audit**: Enable detailed logs for governance.

## Troubleshooting

*Connection failed? Verify credentials, network/VPN, and source API status.*

- **Missing tables?** Refresh metadata on the source.
- **Slow queries?** Filter early, limit columns, and enable caching.
- **Auth errors?** Re-authorize OAuth and confirm scopes.

## Get Support

For assistance with using *Connect AI*, there are two main resources available:

- The [Status page](https://status.cdata.com/), which shows the current status and incident history for the application services.
- [CData Technical Support](https://www.cdata.com/support/submit.aspx), which you can also access by clicking the **Support** link at the bottom of the dashboard.
