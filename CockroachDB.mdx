## Prerequisites

#### Whitelist CData IPs

To establish a connection to CockroachDB, you need to allow access to CockroachDB via CData’s IP. When hosting CockroachDB behind a firewall, you must safelist these IP addresses in your firewall.

- Range: `52.224.0.160` to `52.224.0.175` and `4.154.117.160` to `4.154.117.175`.
- CIDR notation: `52.224.0.160/28` and `4.154.117.160/28`

#### Ensure CockroachDB Is Publicly Accessible

Provide a public facing IP/domain to connect to this data source. The following private IP ranges do not work:

- `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
- `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
- `127.0.0.1` (aka ‘localhost’)

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect CockroachDB to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *CockroachDB* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **Password**—the user password
	- **User**—the CockroachDB username for authentication
	- **Server**—the host name or IP address of the CockroachDB server
	- **Database**—the name of the CockroachDB database you want to access, set as the default database if not specified
	- **Port**—the port for connecting to the CockroachDB server
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add CockroachDB Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
