## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect Exact Online to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.

Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *Exact Online* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Select a region in the **Region** drop-down list that is associated with your Exact Online administration.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign in** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the Exact Online sign-in page in a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your Exact Online account and provide the requested permissions (if applicable).
</Step>
<Step>
The **Division** field populates with the divisions associated with your Exact Online administration. Select a division from the drop-down list. The default value is the first division in the list.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Exact Online Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
