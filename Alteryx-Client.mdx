## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.
- If you are connecting to Connect AI using Alteryx Desktop, you must have the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server installed. Click [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2280794) for the download.
