## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
- Create a [Workspace](/Workspaces). Later, you will use the **OData Service URL** on that page (*https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/{workspace\_name}*) with the relevant workspace name to establish the connection.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

## Connect to Connect AI

To establish a connection from Mendix to Connect AI using the OData protocol, follow these steps.

Then, download the OData metadata file according to the steps below.

### Downloading the OData Metadata File

When creating a connection in Mendix, the connection flow requires a Data Source Contract File. Follow these steps to download the OData metadata file for Connect AI using *curl*, a command line tool:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open a command-line window for your operating system.
	- On Windows, open the start menu, type *cmd*, and press the enter key to open a command prompt.
	- On macOS and Linux, open a Terminal window.
</Step>
<Step>
To check if curl is installed on your system, type *curl -help* and press the enter key. If it is not installed, install it from [the curl website](https://curl.se/).
</Step>
<Step>
Issue the following curl command, replacing `[user]` with your Connect AI username and `[PAT]` with the PAT you generated above:
```bash
curl -u [user]:[PAT] https://cloud.cdata.com/api/odata/service/$metadata -o metadata.xml
```
</Step>
<Step>
Locate the metadata.xml file that the curl command created and move it to an accessible location.
</Step>
</Steps>
