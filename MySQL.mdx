## Prerequisites

#### Whitelist CData IPs

To establish a connection to MySQL, you need to allow access to MySQL via CData’s IP. When hosting MySQL behind a firewall, you must safelist these IP addresses in your firewall.

- Range: `52.224.0.160` to `52.224.0.175` and `4.154.117.160` to `4.154.117.175`.
- CIDR notation: `52.224.0.160/28` and `4.154.117.160/28`

#### Ensure MySQL Is Publicly Accessible

Provide a public facing IP/domain to connect to this data source. The following private IP ranges do not work:

- `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
- `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
- `127.0.0.1` (aka ‘localhost’)

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect MySQL to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *MySQL* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
If your MySQL connection is behind a firewall, set the **Connection Type** to **SSH Tunnel** and follow the instructions in [SSH Tunnel Instructions](#ssh-tunnel-instructions). Then continue with these instructions. Otherwise, leave the **Connection Type** as **Direct**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **Server**—the host name or IP address of the MySQL server. Cluster servers are supported (for example, `192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2`).
	- **Port**—the port for connecting to the MySQL server.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the Authentication method, then proceed to the relevant section and follow those instructions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Methods

### Password

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **User**—the MySQL username for authentication.
	- **Password**—the user password.
	- **Database**—(Optional) the name of the MySQL database.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add MySQL Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
### AzureAD

<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **User**—the MySQL username for authentication.
	- **Azure Tenant**—the MySQL tenant that you want to use to access data.

## SSH Tunnel Instructions

If your MySQL data source is behind a firewall, follow these instructions.

<Steps>
<Step>
Click **Connection Type** of **SSH Tunnel**.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the following information:
	- **SSH Server**–enter the name of the SSH server.
	- **SSH Port**–enter the SSH port. The default value is 22.
	- **SSH Auth Mode**–enter the authentication mode of **Password** or **Public\_Key**.
		- If **Password**, enter the **SSH User** name and **SSH Password**.
		- If **Public\_Key**, enter the **SSH User** name, **SSH Client Cert**, and **SSH Client Cert Password** (optional). Only PEMKEY\_BLOB is available as the **SSH Client Cert Type**. The **SSH Client Cert** is required, and is a valid private key. Enter the **SSH Client Cert Password** if the SSH client certificate has a password.
</Step>
<Step>
Continue with the authentication instructions in the [Setup Guide](#setup-guide).
