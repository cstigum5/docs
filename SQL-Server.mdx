## Authentication

Applications connect to the Virtual SQL Server through SQL Server Authentication using a Username and Password. When configuring the connection, set the properties as follows:

- The database server is **tds.cdata.com**.
- The port is **14333**. If you are connecting from application that does not have a separate port field, append the port to the end of the database server with either a colon or comma (`tds.cdata.com:14333` or `tds.cdata.com,14333`).
- Some applications require you to specify a database. For these applications, the database name is the name of the [Connection](/Sources) you want to access.
- For the Username, enter your Connect AI username. This is displayed in the top-right corner of the Connect AI interface. For example, *test@cdata.com*.
- For the Password, enter a Personal Access Token (PAT) that you generate on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page.
