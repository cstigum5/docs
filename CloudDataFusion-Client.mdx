## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Cloud Data Fusion with Connect AI, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.

You must also generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.
