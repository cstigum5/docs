## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to connect SAP ByDesign to your Connect AI account:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Connections** page of the Connect AI dashboard.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **\+ Add Connection** in the upper-right corner.
</Step>
<Step>
Type *SAP ByDesign* into the search field, then click the data source name.
</Step>
<Step>
On the **Basic Settings** tab of the new connection, enter a connection name or keep the default name.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the **URL** to your system host name. This URL should conform to the following format: `https://my999999.businessbydesign.cloud.sap;`.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the SAP ByDesign username for authentication in the **User** field.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **Password** field, enter the user password.
</Step>
<Step>
Select the **Service Type** from `AnalyticsService`, `CustomService`, or `ODataDataSource`.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add SAP ByDesign Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
