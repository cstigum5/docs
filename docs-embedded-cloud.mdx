## Key Features

- **Broad Data Connectivity:** Embedded Cloud allows you to transform data into a simple language that any reporting tool, analytics dashboard, or spreadsheet can understand. It can connect to a vast range of applications (including those for accounting, marketing, customer relationship management, and more) by using a consistent approach that is already supported by many data tools.
- **Real-Time Data Access:** Embedded Cloud gives you access to your data in real time, which creates an agile and flexible work environment that adapts and changes as quickly as your data does. This approach avoids the pitfalls of traditional Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes that rely on moving data to separate locations.
- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Support:** Read and Write operations are supported. Operations are controlled by security settings that you can configure in Embedded Cloud or in your data sources.
- **Secure Access:** Administrators can create query users and define their access permissions for each data source individually.
- **Comprehensive Data Model & Dynamic Discovery:** Embedded Cloud provides comprehensive access to all of the data that is exposed in the underlying connections, including full access to dynamic data and searchable metadata.
