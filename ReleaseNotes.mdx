### What’s New

#### Caching

<Frame>
![](/images/caching.png)
</Frame>

Say goodbye to slow data connections with Connect AI’s new caching feature. The user selects tables to be cached, or saved to a database. Connect AI then fetches data for the selected tables on a scheduled basis, ensuring swift and reliable access to data whenever you need it.

With caching, you no longer have to wait while the driver retrieves live data. When you enable caching on a table, Connect AI runs database queries against the *cached* data, not the live data.

The caching feature allows for incremental updates, improving performance. When you create a caching job, Connect AI tries to find date or date+time columns in the database that show which rows are new or have changed since the last run. Connect AI can then run the caching job for those rows only. Otherwise, Connect AI runs a full update.

</Update>

SELECT BillingState, Name FROM Account WHERE Industry = @InputSheet!A2
