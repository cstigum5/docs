## Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first do the following:

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Connections](/Sources) for more information.
- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.
- If you want to connect to a workspace rather than a data source, first [Add a workspace](/Workspaces#add-a-workspace) to Workspaces.
