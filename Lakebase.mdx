## Prerequisites

To use the OAuthClient authentication method, you must create a service principle in Databricks Lakebase and assign permissions. Refer to the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/users-groups/manage-service-principals).

Next, the account or workspace administrator creates an OAuth secret:

<Steps>
<Step>
At the new service principal's details page, in the **Developer Service Principal** section, click the **Secrets** tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Under OAuth secrets, click the **Generate secret** button.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the desired lifetime for the secret in days, up to a maximum of 730 days (two years). The admin console displays updated details about the new service principal, including the OAuth secret and the Client ID (which is the same as the service principal's application ID).
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the Client Id and Secret in the fields below.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication Methods

### OAuthClient

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter the **OAuthClientId** assigned when you configured the service principal (in the prerequisites).
</Step>
<Step>
Enter the **OAuthClientSecret** assigned when you configured the service principal (in the prerequisites). This value authenticates the application to the OAuth authorization server.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Databricks Lakebase Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
