	- **OAuth Client Secret**—the client secret assigned when you registered your Adobe Analytics account for OAuth.
	- **RSID**—(optional) your report suite identifier. To find your RSID, navigate to **Admin** > **Report Suites**. If left blank, the connection tries to detect it automatically.

	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
