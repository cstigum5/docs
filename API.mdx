## REST API

Connect AI provides a full-featured [REST API](/REST-API) that allows any REST-compatible application or integration tool capable of creating HTTP requests to query data, perform batch operations, and execute stored procedures across all data sources configured in your account. This API is based on a JSON-formatted API.

## OData

Connect AI exposes an OData API which adheres to the OData v4 specification. This allows clients that can consume OData APIs to easily integrate with Connect AI. Through the Connect AI workspaces feature, you can customize the data you surface to Integrations and create a single endpoint for any integration that supports OData connections.

Refer to the [OData](/OData-Dashboard) overview page for more information about configuring and using the OData protocol.

## OpenAPI

Connect AI supports the [OpenAPI](/OpenAPI) specification version 2.0 and 3.0, allowing you to connect no-code/low-code applications that integrate with OpenAPI easily. Connect AI allows you to download an OpenAPI document from a workspace. You can then import the OpenAPI document into applications that support OpenAPI.
