The upper-right corner of the page displays buttons to adjust data for the past **1 Day**, **7 Days**, and **30 Days**. Clicking one of these buttons refreshes the page and adjusts the displayed data accordingly.

## Information Boxes

Information boxes at the top of the page display the quantity for each of these four categories in the selected time period:

- **Rows:** The rows that are processed
- **Queries:** The queries that are performed
- **Active Connections:** The active connections on your account
<Frame>

Underneath the count, each box displays the percentage change compared to the previous time period. This percentage change adjusts dynamically based on the time period that is selected.

## Data Visuals

Under the information boxes, the **Dashboard** page displays two visuals:

- **Queries/Rows Over Time**
- **Queries/Rows by Connection**

### Queries/Rows Over Time

This bar graph shows the total number of queries or total rows returned in the child account over the selected time period. The x-axis displays the dates, and the y-axis displays the number of queries/rows.

</Frame>
Each bar is composed of two sections:

- The number of successful queries or rows returned, displayed top portion of the bar and colored blue
- The number of failed queries, displayed as the bottom portion of the bar and colored red

Clicking the down arrow icon in the upper-right corner of the section opens an export menu. This menu enables you to export the graph as a data file.

### Queries/Rows by Connection

This table displays the number of queries or total rows by each connection in the selected time period.

There are three columns in this table:

- **Connection:** The name that is given to the connection on the **Connections** tab
- **Queries:** The total number of queries, both successful and failed, that are made by the connection in the selected time period
- **Successful:** The percentage of queries from the connector that succeed in the selected time period

Clicking the name of a column sorts the table by that column. If the table is already sorted by the selected column, the sort function toggles between ascending and descending order.
