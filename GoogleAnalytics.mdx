## Authentication Methods

### OAuth

<Steps>
<Step>
Select your **Schema**. The options are `GoogleAnalytics4` or `UniversalAnalytics`.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign in with Google** to connect securely through OAuth. This action opens the Google Analytics sign-in page on a new tab.
</Step>
<Step>
Log in to your Google Analytics account.
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Continue** to grant the requested permissions.

<Note>
Each permission is required for the connection to function.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step>
If you selected `GoogleAnalytics4` as the schema, the **Property Id** field populates with your property Ids. Select a property Id from the drop-down list. The default value is the first property Id. You can also enter a custom value.
</Step>
<Step>
If you selected `UniversalAnalytics` as the schema, enter your **Profile** and select your **API version**.
</Step>
<Step>
At the top of the Connect AI **Add Google Analytics Connection** page, click **Save & Test**.

	- If the connection test succeeds, a **Connection successfully saved** message appears, indicating that your connection has been created. The **Status** on the **Edit Connection** page also changes to **Authenticated**. View the data model of your successful connection in the right pane of the **Edit Connection** page, in the **Data Model** tab.
	- If the connection test fails, ensure that you entered your login information correctly with no stray spaces or other characters. Connect AI displays error messages under the required fields with missing data. Some data sources require that you sign in directly to the source website. If you did not, an error message appears under the **Sign in** button. Correct the errors and try again.
	- Unsuccessful connections are saved as drafts and have a **Status** of **Not Authenticated**. You can return to the connection and authenticate it later.
</Step>
</Steps>
### OAuthJWT

<Steps>
<Step>
Enter your **OAuth JWT Cert**. This is a multi-line key in the format shown.
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your **OAuth JWT Subject**. This must be set to the email address of the user whose data you want to access. The account must also be part of a GSuite domain.
</Step>
<Step>
Select your **Schema**. The options are `GoogleAnalytics4` and `UniversalAnalytics`.
</Step>
<Step>
(Optional) In the **Property Id** field, enter the Google Analytics profile that you want to use. If you leave this field blank, the connection uses the first returned profile.
</Step>
<Step>
If you selected `GoogleAnalytics4` as the schema, enter the **Property Id**.
