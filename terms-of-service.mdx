#### 5. PAYMENT OF FEES

**5.1 Calculation of Fees.** Customer will pay CDATA the applicable fees described in each Order Form (the “Fees”). Fees for committed prepaid subscriptions are identified on the initial Order Form. Except as otherwise provided herein or as set forth by our payment processor here https://stripe.com, all fees are nonrefundable. Per-Authorized User pricing assumes normal query usage per paying Authorized User of the Services. If Customer’s use of the Cloud Services exceeds the capacity set forth herein or on the Order Form(s), or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees, CDATA will invoice Customer in arrears for such additional usage and Customer agrees to pay the additional Fees in the manner provided herein.

Full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by CDATA within 30 days after the issuance of the invoice (which may be sent by email). If Customer is paying by credit card, Customer represents and warrants that it has the right to use the credit card provided and grants CDATA the right to provide the credit card information, including the credit card number, its expiration date and billing address, to third parties for the purposes of facilitating payment transactions. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any payment transaction. Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Cloud Services. Customer is responsible for any sales, use, value added, excise, property, withholding or similar tax and any related tariffs, and similar charges, except taxes based on CDATA’s net income. If Customer is required to pay any such taxes, Customer shall pay such taxes with no reduction or offset in the amounts payable to CDATA hereunder. If an applicable tax authority requires CDATA to pay any taxes that should have been payable by Customer, CDATA will advise Customer in writing, and Customer will promptly reimburse CDATA for the amounts paid. If Customer believes that CDATA has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact CDATA no later than 60 days after the date of the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to CDATA’s accounting department. Without limiting its other remedies, CDATA may suspend Cloud Services for nonpayment of fees.
