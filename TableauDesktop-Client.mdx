<Note>
Before you can configure and use Tableau Desktop with Connect AI, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
</Note>

There are two ways to establish this connection, each with its own benefits and drawbacks:

- **Using the Tableau Desktop Connector**: This method provides the best performance for your reports. However, reports created using this method cannot be published, so they are limited to the local environment. This method is recommended unless you need to publish your reports.
- **Using the Virtual SQL Server API**: This method allows you to publish your reports outside the local environment. However, the performance of this method might not meet the same standard as the connector. This method is only recommended if you need to publish your reports.

Follow the steps below for your chosen connection method.

## Method 1: Use the Connector

The Tableau Desktop Connector for Connect AI can be used to establish a connection in both the desktop and server editions of Tableau. The connector includes comprehensive high-performance data access, real-time integration, extensive metadata discovery, and robust SQL-92 support.

### Step 1: Install the Connector

Follow the directions below for your environment.

#### Tableau Desktop

**Prerequisites**

Before you start, you must have a supported Tableau application installed. Supported applications include:

- Tableau Desktop 2020.1 or later
- Tableau Prep 2020.4.1 or later.

For older versions of Tableau Desktop, please use either [ODBC](/ODBC-Client) or [JDBC](/JDBC-Client) instead.

**Installation Instructions**

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, follow these steps to install the connector:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Integrations** page of Connect AI.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **BI and Reporting Tools** section, click **Tableau Desktop**.
</Step>
<Step>
Download and run the setup file. If Tableau Desktop is running during installation, you will need to close and reopen it after the installation finishes.
</Step>
<Step>
Once the installation is complete, click **Finish**.
</Step>
</Steps>

If you have Tableau Desktop 2020.3 or later, the setup automatically attempts to register the driver with your Tableau install. By default, the driver `.jar` file is placed into:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers`
- Mac: `/Users/myuser/Library/Tableau/Drivers`

By default, the connector `.taco` file is placed into:

- Windows: `C:\Users\myuser\Documents\My Tableau Repository\Connectors`
- Mac: `/Users/myuser/Documents/My Tableau Repository/Connectors`

**Manual Registration**

If you are using Tableau Prep or a version of Tableau Desktop earlier than 2020.3, the Connect AI Connector setup will not be able to detect your Tableau install. After completing setup, you will need to register the connector manually by following these steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
Find the connector install directory. By default, this is `C:\Program Files\CData\Tableau Connector for CData Connect 2021` for Windows and `/Applications/Tableau Connector for CData Connect 2021` for MacOS.
</Step>
<Step>
Find your Tableau repository. Your repository is usually located in your documents folder with the name `My Tableau Repository`. If you are using Prep, it is called `My Tableau Prep Repository`.
</Step>
<Step>
Open the Tableau install directory and open the `lib` directory. Copy `cdata.Cloud.legacy.taco` into the `Connectors` directory within your Tableau repository.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
As of Tableau Prep 21.2+, standard taco files are supported instead of legacy taco files.
</Note>

#### Tableau Server

**Prerequisites**

Before you start, you must have a supported Tableau application installed. This includes Tableau Server 2020.1 or later.

For older versions of Tableau Server, please use either the [CData ODBC Driver](/ODBC-Client) or the [JDBC driver for Connect AI](/JDBC-Client) instead.

<Note>
If a connector has the same class as a connector previously registered, the new one will be rejected.
</Note>

**Install Instructions**

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, follow these steps to install the connector:

<Steps>
<Step>
Open the **Integrations** page.
</Step>
<Step>
In the **BI and Reporting Tools** section, click **Tableau Desktop**.
</Step>
<Step>
Download and run the setup file. If Tableau Server is running during installation, you will need to close and reopen it after the installation finishes.
</Step>
<Step>
Once the installation is complete, click **Finish**.
</Step>
<Step>
A JAR file will be automatically placed in the Drivers directory, which is `C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers` by default. This file needs to remain here for the connector to function properly.
</Step>
<Step>
Make sure that the license file (.lic) is placed alongside the JAR in the `Drivers` folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Drop the `.taco` file into `[RootDirectory]/data/tabsvc/vizqlserver/Connectors`. The root directory is likely to be `ProgramData` on the drive Tableau Server is installed on.
</Step>
<Step>
Restart the server.
</Step>
<Step>
To use an unsigned packaged connector, optionally disable signature verification by setting `native_api.disable_verify_connector_plugin_signature` to `true` via TSM.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Connecting to Connect AI

Once the connector is installed, open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Server and perform the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
In the **Connect** sidebar menu, under the **To a Server** category, click **More…**
</Step>
<Step>
Use the search field or locate and click **CData Connect by CData**.
</Step>
<Step>
A sign-in prompt appears. Click **Sign In**.
</Step>
<Step>
Sign in to your Connect AI account.
</Step>
<Step>
After signing in, or if you are already signed in, your connection appears in the **Connections** pane on the left.
</Step>
</Steps>

You can now use the desired Schema in Tableau.

## Method 2: Use Virtual SQL Server

As an alternative to downloading and installing the connector, you can connect to the Connect AI Virtual SQL Server API. This method is only recommended if you need to publish your reports.

### Prerequisites

Before you connect, you must first generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page of Connect AI. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

### Connect to Connect AI

To establish a connection from Tableau Desktop to the Connect AI Virtual SQL Server API, follow these steps.

<Steps>
<Step>
In Tableau Desktop, open a new book. Under **To a Server**, select **More**, then **Microsoft SQL Server**.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/tableau_desktop_sql.png" alt="Tableau Desktop SQL" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Enter your credentials:
- **Server**—enter the Virtual SQL Server endpoint and port separated by a comma: *tds.cdata.com*,*14333*
- **Database**—enter the Connection Name of the Connect AI data source you want to connect to (for example, *Salesforce1*).
- **Authentication**—select **Use a specific username and password**.
- **Username**—enter your Connect AI username. This is displayed in the top-right corner of the Connect AI interface. For example, *test@cdata.com*.
- **Password**—enter the PAT you generated on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page.
- **Require SSL**—leave this selected.

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Click **Sign In**. The authentication process may take a few minutes.
</Step>
</Steps>





After you successfully sign in, you can access your data in the Tableau Desktop sidebar to create and publish reports.
