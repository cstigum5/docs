## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use GitHub Copilot with Connect AI, you must do the following:
<Steps>
<Step>
 Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.
</Step>
<Step>
Install and enable GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (or any IDE supporting GitHub Copilot).
</Step>
<Step>
Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Create the Configuration File
<Steps>
<Step>
Create a folder named `.vscode` in your project repository. Within this folder, create a file named `mcp.json` and add the following configuration. Replace `Basic <your_base64_encoded_email_PAT>` with `Basic` and the Base64-encoded value of `username:PAT` (the PAT was generated in the prerequisites).
	```bash
	{
	  "servers": {
	      "cdata-mcp": {
	      "type": "http",
	      "url": "https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp",
	      "headers": {
	         "Authorization": "Basic <your_base64_encoded_email_PAT>"
	     }
	   }
	  },
	 "inputs": []
	}
	```
</Step>
</Steps>
## Start the MCP Server

</Step>
</Steps>
## Chat with GitHub Copilot

You can now chat with GitHub Copilot and issue contextual prompts. As a test, you can provide the MCP server with a simple prompt, such as a list of tables for a particular connection. GitHub Copilot uses the Connect AI tools such as `getCatalogs`, `getSchemas`, and `getTables` to retrieve data from the connected data source.
