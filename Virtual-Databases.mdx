## Overview

**Virtual Databases** provide a new way to access, model, govern, and deliver data. A virtual database mimics a real database. Applications can connect like they normally would to a database, but the connection is actually a live data connection to the data source. Virtual databases use well-known SQL constructs through a virtual relational layer, allowing you to perform any query involving several data sources.

## Virtual SQL Server

CData’s [Virtual SQL Server](/SQL-Server) implements the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol. It emulates a standard SQL server and allows you to query your data like any other SQL source. Virtual SQL server endpoints are available by using workspaces in Connect AI. The default Virtual SQL server allows access to all tables, but you can connect to a workspace if you want to restrict access to a specific number of data assets.
