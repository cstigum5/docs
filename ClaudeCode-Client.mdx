## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Claude Code with Connect AI, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/Sources) for more information.

Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

## Connect to Connect AI
<Steps>
<Step>
 Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run the following command:
	```bash
	npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
	```
</Step>
<Step>
 Once the installation is done, try running: `npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` in your terminal to confirm the installation. You should see something like this:
	```bash
	\`C:\Users\ConnectAIUser\AppData\Roaming\npm\`
	\`-- @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.28
	```
</Step>
<Step>
 Create a project named `Claude code` and open it in Visual Studio Code.
</Step>
<Step>
 In the terminal of your project, run the following command:
	`claude mcp add --transport http connectmcp https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Basic {Your_Base64Encoded_EMAIL:PAT}"`
	This creates a JSON file with your MCP Server.
</Step>
<Step>
 Type `claude`. A welcome screen appears:

</Step>
<Step>
 Choose a text style and login method. Claude Code opens the browser to log in to Claude.
</Step>
<Step>
 You can now interact with the MCP server:
